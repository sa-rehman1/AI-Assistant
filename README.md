AI-Powered Assistant for Teachers
Problem Statement
Teachers struggle to efficiently analyze student performance, create engaging quizzes, summarize complex lessons, and plan effective units. Current methods involve manual data entry, time-consuming grading, and tedious lesson planning, leaving teachers with limited time for personalized instruction and student engagement. An AI-powered assistant that can automate performance analysis, generate quizzes, summarize lessons, and create lesson plans can help teachers streamline their workflow, improve student outcomes, and enhance their overall teaching experience.
